SwiftCalc
=========

We have two working versions:

  One number at a time -
    Like a normal calculator, a user is only able to input one number at a time.
    We do not have to worry about order of operations.
    Simple code, does not demonstrate data structures in Swift.
    
  Evaluate at the end -
    More like an Excel spread sheet, a user enters an entire expression then it is solved.
    Order of operations is a problem.
    More complex code, demonstrates many more of Swift's features.
    
If we can fix the order of operations in the "Evaluate at the end" method, I think we should demo that one.
However, that may be more trouble than it is worth for such a simple app.
